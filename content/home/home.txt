    Arrivals + Departures is an interactive public installation about birth, death and the journey in between by YARA + DAVINA.
    
    Taking the recognisable form of a station or airport arrivals and departures board, the artwork invites the public to share the names of people who have arrived and departed as a way to celebrate a birth or commemorate a death.
